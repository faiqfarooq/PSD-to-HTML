            The number one cause of death for American teens is auto accidents.
            Also, accidents send 285,000 teens to the hospital each year. These
            statistics haven't changed in over ten years, despite a steady
            decline in overall traffic fatalities and changes to state licensing
            laws.<br /> <p  style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Why is that?</b></p> Simply put, we are putting teens in cars that are
            too old and ill-equipped to protect them. Studies conducted by The
            Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have proven this fact. The
            problem is that parents unknowingly put the worst driver in the
            family in the most out-dated, inadequate vehicle in the family
            fleet. It's time to lose the "put the kid in the jalopy because they
            will wreck it" mentality.

            Today's cars are the safest, strongest vehicles ever built and come
            equipped with tools to keep inexperienced drivers out of trouble. 
            Some even come equipped with tools to help you monitor and coach 
            your teen driver. You have many options as a parent, but it can be
            confusing to navigate the hundreds of combinations of feature names
            , model changes, and prices. <br><br>
            Our mission is to educate all parents about the statistics facing 
            teen drivers, explain car features designed to protect them, and match
            the safest cars to your child and your budget. While no car can guarantee
            a fatality will not occur, you will sleep better at night knowing you have
            made a wise choice and done everything you can to protect your family from
            the unthinkable. That's our promise.
